# Drupal GovCon
Welcome to the repo for the Drupal GovCon event website.

Tools we are using:
[Acquia BLT](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/8.x/)

## Prereqs

- A Mac (these instructions are primarily for a Mac host running El Capitan or Sierra)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
 - [Vagrant hostsupdater plugin](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/install/) > 8
- [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) > 2.1

## Quickstart Instructions

- Before you start, do `ssh-add -l` to ensure your private key is registered. If not (especially after a system update), do `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to do this.
- Install the prereqs above by following [BLT's Installing Requirements](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/8.x/INSTALL.md#installing-requirements) and then `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`
- **Fork this repo**
- Clone repo locally (clone **your fork**, do NOT clone the main repo)
- Configure a remote for the main repo (replace upstream with whatever naming makes sense to you) `git remote add upstream git@github.com:Drupal4Gov/Drupal-GovCon-2017.git`
- First Run: from the repo root, go to /box/project.local.yml, anc change line 5 from `local: capitalcamp.local` to `local: self`
- From the repo root, run `composer install`
- `composer blt-alias`
- `source ~/.bash_profile`
- `blt vm`
- Access local Drupal install at http://local.capitalcamp.com/

## Troubleshooting

### Cybersquatting site for capitalcamp.com loads in browser instead local Drupal install
It's likely your /etc/hosts file wasn't updated properly. Ensure you have the [Vagrant hostsupdater plugin](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) `vagrant plugin list` and then try to reprovision your VM from the box dir with `vagrant reload --provision`

### PHP version is not correct
blt/composer may complain that you have the wrong PHP version. If this happens there are a lot of options for installing a different version of PHP. Easiest is probably with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). After installing PHP 5.6 with homebrew you may need to reorder your path to include /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin. To do this run the following commands:

`echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`

`source ~/.bash_profile`
