# KSS Style Guide

This web site is built using Sass and component-based styles. This front-end style guide documents the design components and the Sass variables, functions and mixins used to build the site. Our Sass files are organized in a file hierarchy like this:

* base: contains base html styling, variables, and mixins.
* components: component-based styles. Components are segmented into atoms, blocks, navigation, regions, and views.
* layout: component styles that only apply layout to major chunks of the page.
* style-guide: some helper files needed to build this automated style guide.
