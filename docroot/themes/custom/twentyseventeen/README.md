## Cog: Acquia D8 Theme

Cog is a developer-focused base theme and starterkit created by Acquia's Professional Service FrontEnd Team. It intended as a minimalist starting point for custom theming, while exposing common tools and workflows. Cog provides a small amount of code to get started, but still packed with utilities and documentation to start quickly.

### Features

* Responsive containers built on Susy grid system
* Initial SMACSS file architecture
* Common Twig files and theme dependencies
* Base preprocess functions for class definitions
* Modular gulp tasks for compiling and linting
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node

## Set up your Theme with Cog

Cog is created with the intent of being used as a traditional base theme. By following the steps listed next, you will be cloning the starter sub-theme located in `cog/STARTERKIT`. This allows for proper delineation of the original Cog code from the flexible aspects of your custom theme.  

```
contrib/ (theme folder)
|-- cog/
|---- STARTERKIT/ 
custom/ (theme folder)
|-- mytheme/ (cloned from starterkit) 
```

### Create your custom sub-theme

* In your `themes/` directory create the `contrib` and `custom` directories
* Download Cog into the `themes/contrib` folder and enable Cog using `drush en cog`
* Set Cog as your default theme: `drush config-set system.theme default cog`
* To create a subtheme using the default options use `drush cog "MyTheme"`
* Enable your new `MyTheme` theme with `drush en mytheme` which is located in `themes/custom`
* Set `MyTheme` as your default theme `drush config-set system.theme default mytheme`

Available options for creating your new theme `drush help cog`

### Setup locally for development

Once you have created a custom subtheme, you will know follow these quick steps to start. If you would like to review extension explanations of these steps, be sure to read the [full setup readme](_readme/setup-full.md).

* Navigate to `themes/custom/mytheme` folder in your terminal
* Install Node.js with `./install-node.sh 4.4.4` and then point to the proper version with `source ~/.bashrc && nvm use --delete-prefix 4.4.4` 
* If you are not using avn then run `nvm use 4.4.4` when closing and reopening your session
* If you choose to use avn follow the instructions [here](_readme/setup-full.md#avn)
* Install local library dependencies `npm run install-tools`
* To confirm Gulp and other items are instantiated `npm run build`
* You can now compile both your Sass and JS with `gulp watch` from your theme directory


## Theme Architecture Overview

### Files & Folder Structure

The core files are fairly minimal when setting up a new theme. These files are considered as the initial configurable pieces. 

```
|-- css/  (generated css) 
|-- gulp-tasks/ (modular gulp task files)
|-- images/  (theme images)
|-- js/  (compiled js)
|-- sass/  (SMACSS based sass setup)
|-- gulpfile.js  (configured gulp file) 
|-- install-node.sh (bash script to install nvm and node)
|-- logo.png (placeholder logo png file)
|-- logo.svg (placeholder logo svg file)
|-- node_modules/  (modules generated by npm)
|-- package.json  (configured to load dependencies by npm)
|-- README-SETUP.md (Quickstart documentation theme)
|-- screenshot.png (placeholder theme screenshot file)
|-- [theme-name].info.yml (theme config file)
|-- [theme-name].libraries.yml (starter libraries file to load theme assets)
|-- [theme-name].theme (file to use for preprocess functions)
|-- theme-settings.php (file to use for making theme settings available in the GUI)
```


### Sass Structure

Setup of the Sass files so that they are properly broken out in partials and according to the SMACSS methodologies.

```
sass/
  |-- _config.scss
  |-- _reset.scss
  |-- base/
  |-- layout/
  |-- components/
  |-- state/
  |-- style-guide-only/
  |---- homepage.md
  |---- kss-only.scss
  |-- style.scss
```

* **_config.scss** this configuration is housing common mixins, variables, or similar, normally you would want to break these out in separate partials
* **styles.scss**  the manifest file that imports all the partials or folders with globbing 
* **base/** intended as the baseline pstyles that you extend upon and will include things like resets, global typography, or common form selectors.
* **layout/**  for structural layout that can apply to both the outer containers like the sidebars or headers, but also on inner structual pieces.
* **components/** these module files are the reusable or component parts of our design.
* **state/** modules will adjust when in a particular state, in regards to targeting how changes happen on contextual alterations for regions or similar  
* **style-guide-only/** contains homepage.md which provides the content for the Overview section of the styleguide, and kss-only.scss which generates a css file for styling needed by a component for display in the style guide, but not loaded into the actual theme  

### Gulp 

The Gulp installation and tasks are setup to work on install, but are still intended to be easily updates based on project needs. The tasks are declared in `gulpfile.js` and broken out within the `gulp-tasks/` subfolder. You can list the available Gulp tasks with `gulp --tasks`. The most common gulp task is `gulp watch` when developing locally, which covers Sass compiling, JS linting, and building dynamic styleguides.  


### JavaScript Files

An example JS file `theme.js` is added by default in the `js/` folder. This file contains sample code wrapped in the `Drupal.behaviors` code standard. This JS file is added to the theme with the following portion of the code from `[theme-name].libraries.yml`. Cog does not have compression enabled for Gulp since it is relying on Drupal's caching system. 

```
lib:
  js:
    js/theme.js: {}
```

### Theme Layout


#### Grid System

The Cog grid structure was setup with the intent of having a very minimalist starting point. The theme grid container is setup with a single class `.mq--t` located in `layout/_containers.scss` that contains the following starter Susy container: `@include container(80em)`. In the `layout/_sidebars.scss` file is the column code for each combination of sidebars based on the Susy syntax. The body classes are defined with a preprocess conditional in `[theme-name].theme` for each scenario.

#### Theme Regions

The regions avaiable are standard with classic sidebar region, along with pre and post content areas. The intent is to allow for containers to go full-width and rely on the grid containers for inner Susy containers. 

```
[theme-name].info.yml

regions:
  branding: Branding
  header: Header
  pre_content: 'Pre Content'
  content: Content
  sidebar_first: 'Sidebar first'
  sidebar_second: 'Sidebar second'
  post_content: 'Post Content'
  footer: Footer
```

### Images 

The images designated for your custom theme can be placed in the `images/` folder. By default we do not have compression setup with subfolder, but do highly recommend based on need. Image compression and spriting requires vast differences with the amount images and this can be a task-intensive process for Gulp and automated builds. However for most of our builds, we do utilize both image compression and spriting with the standard subfolders with Gulp automation workflow: `images/src/` `images/dist/`


## Further Documentation

Cog also ships with an extensive list of documentation and code samples that were intentionally left of of the theme. 
We have collected all the examples in an easy reference [listed here](_theming-guide/readme.md).




## Build Notes

At the current time warnings are displayed for graceful-fs and lodash, these are known issues with gulp 3.x and will no longer be an issue once gulp 4.x is available.
