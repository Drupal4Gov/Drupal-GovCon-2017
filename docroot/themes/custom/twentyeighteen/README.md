## Installation

The Cog theme is set up to utilize the `base => sub-theme` relationship. The steps below will create your custom sub-theme that is cloned from `STARTERKIT/` folder, along with installing the proper dependencies to setup in a matter of minutes. This approach supports release updates, in addition to providing source references for required and optional pieces.

### Create Cog Sub-Theme

* In your `themes/` directory create the `contrib/` and `custom/` directories
* Download Cog into the `themes/contrib` folder and enable using `drush en cog`
* Create the sub-theme with `drush cog "MyTheme"` (if you'd like to customize, first run `drush help cog` to see available options)
* Enable your new `MyTheme` theme with `drush en mytheme` which is located in `themes/custom`
* Set `MyTheme` as your default theme `drush config-set system.theme default mytheme`

### Setup Local Development

Once you have created a custom sub-theme, you will setup for local compiling. If you would like to review a more detailed explanation of these steps, read the [full setup readme](_readme/setup-full.md).

* Navigate to `themes/custom/mytheme` folder in your terminal
* Install Node.js with `./install-node.sh 4.4.4` and then point to the proper version with `source ~/.bashrc && nvm use --delete-prefix 4.4.4` 
  * (optional) If you are not using avn then run `nvm use 4.4.4` when closing and reopening your session
  * (optional) If you choose to use avn follow the instructions [here](_readme/setup-full.md#avn)
* Run the command `npm install` within your `themes/custom/mytheme` folder
* Install the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build tool globally using `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
* To confirm Gulp and other items are instantiated `npm run build`
* You can now compile both your Sass and JS with `gulp watch`

## Theme Overview

Cog is a developer-focused base theme and starterkit created by Acquia's Professional Service Front-end Team. It is intended as a minimalistic baseline for custom theming, while exposing common tools and workflows. Cog provides a small amount of code to get started, but is still packed with utilities to extend.

* Responsive containers built on Susy grid system
* Initial SMACSS file architecture
* Common Twig files and theme dependencies
* Base preprocess functions for class definitions
* Modular gulp tasks for compiling and linting
* Living style guide construction via KSS-node

Cog is created with the intent of being used as a traditional base theme. By following the steps listed next, you will be cloning the starter sub-theme located in `cog/STARTERKIT`. This allows for proper delineation of the original Cog code from the flexible aspects of your custom theme.  

```
contrib/ (theme folder)
|-- cog/
|---- STARTERKIT/ 

custom/ (theme folder)
|-- mytheme/ (cloned from starterkit) 
```

### Folder Structure

```
|-- css/  (generated css) 
|-- gulp-tasks/ (modular gulp task files)
|-- images/  (theme images)
|-- js/  (compiled js)
|-- sass/  (SMACSS based sass setup)
|-- gulpfile.js  (configured gulp file) 
|-- install-node.sh (bash script to install nvm and node)
|-- logo.png (placeholder logo png file)
|-- logo.svg (placeholder logo svg file)
|-- node_modules/  (modules generated by npm)
|-- package.json  (configured to load dependencies by npm)
|-- README-SETUP.md (Quickstart documentation theme)
|-- screenshot.png (placeholder theme screenshot file)
|-- [theme-name].info.yml (theme config file)
|-- [theme-name].libraries.yml (starter libraries file to load theme assets)
|-- [theme-name].theme (file to use for preprocess functions)
|-- theme-settings.php (file to use for making theme settings available in the GUI)
```

### Sass Structure

Setup of the Sass files so that they are properly broken out in partials and according to the SMACSS methodologies.

```
sass/
  |-- _config.scss
  |-- _reset.scss
  |-- base/
  |-- layout/
  |-- components/
  |-- state/
  |-- style-guide-only/
  |---- homepage.md
  |---- kss-only.scss
  |-- style.scss
```

* **\_config.scss** this configuration is housing common mixins, variables, or similar, normally you would want to break these out in separate partials
* **styles.scss**  the manifest file that imports all the partials or folders with globbing 
* **base/** intended as the baseline pstyles that you extend upon and will include things like resets, global typography, or common form selectors.
* **layout/**  for structural layout that can apply to both the outer containers like the sidebars or headers, but also on inner structural pieces.
* **components/** these module files are the reusable or component parts of our design.
* **state/** modules will adjust when in a particular state, in regards to targeting how changes happen on contextual alterations for regions or similar  
* **style-guide-only/** contains homepage.md which provides the content for the Overview section of the styleguide, and kss-only.scss which generates a css file for styling needed by a component for display in the style guide, but not loaded into the actual theme  

### Gulp 

The Gulp installation and tasks are setup to work on install, but are still intended to be easily updated based on project needs. The tasks are declared in `gulpfile.js` and broken out within the `gulp-tasks/` subfolder. You can list the available Gulp tasks with `gulp --tasks`. The most common gulp task is `gulp watch` when developing locally, which covers Sass compiling, JS linting, and building dynamic styleguides.  

### JavaScript

An example JS file `theme.js` is added by default in the `js/` folder. This file contains sample code wrapped in the `Drupal.behaviors` code standard. This JS file is added to the theme with the following portion of the code from `[theme-name].libraries.yml`. Cog does not have compression enabled for Gulp since it is relying on Drupal's caching system. 

```
lib:
  js:
    js/theme.js: {}
```

### Grid System

The Cog grid structure was setup with the intent of having a very minimalist starting point. The theme grid container is setup with a single class `.cog--mq` located in `layout/_containers.scss` that contains the following starter Susy container: `@include container(80em)`. In the `layout/_sidebars.scss` file is the column code for each combination of sidebars based on the Susy syntax. The body classes are defined with a preprocess conditional in `[theme-name].theme` for each scenario.

### Theme Regions

The regions available are standard with classic sidebar region, along with pre and post content areas. The intent is to allow for containers to go full-width and rely on the grid containers for inner Susy containers.

```
[theme-name].info.yml

regions:
  branding: Branding
  header: Header
  pre_content: 'Pre content'
  content: Content
  sidebar_first: 'Sidebar first'
  sidebar_second: 'Sidebar second'
  post_content: 'Post content'
  footer: Footer
```

### Images 

The images designated for your custom theme can be placed in the `images/` folder. By default we do not have compression setup with subfolder, but do highly recommend based on need. Image compression and spriting requires vast differences with the amount images and this can be a task-intensive process for Gulp and automated builds. However for most of our builds, we do utilize both image compression and spriting with the standard subfolders with Gulp automation workflow: `images/src/` `images/dist/`

## Further Documentation

Cog also ships with an extensive list of documentation and code samples that which were intentionally left out of the theme. 
We have collected all the examples in an easy reference [listed here](_theming-guide/readme.md).

## Build Notes

At the current time warnings are displayed for graceful-fs and lodash, these are known issues with gulp 3.x and will no longer be an issue once gulp 4.x is available.
