				<h1>Drupal GovCon 2017 Sponsorship</h1>
				<h2>July 31 - August 2, 2017 | National Institutes of Health | Bethesda, MD</h2>
				<p>Since its early days as Capital Camp, Drupal GovCon has been an annual gathering centered around the Drupal community in the Washington, DC metro area. We work together to build new skills, meet other open source advocates, advance Drupal, and build an even greater community. We bring together</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developers</li>
					<li>Site Builders</li>
					<li>Designers</li>
					<li>Content Managers</li>
					<li>Project Managers</li>
					<li>Business Owners</li>
					<li>Job Seekers</li>
					<li>End Users</li>
					<li>and more</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And while “Gov” is in the name, GovCon is not just for the government sector. We welcome government employees, nonprofit leaders, educational organizations, and anyone looking to develop their Drupal skills within a supportive and inclusive environment.</p>
				<!--<p>1000+ <br/>Attendees</p>
				<p>70% <br/> Of our attendees come to learn something new</p>
